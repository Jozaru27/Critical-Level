# Critical-Level
*Home repository for the ***Critical Level*** Page - a Web Project*<br><br>

Critical Level is a web project in which I aspire to create, through my vision, a functional page in which people can express their thoughts and rankings about games, leaving reviews so other players can watch, read and comment, essentially exchanging information about their favourite games. 

The page will work as a IMDB-like service, in which people can either check other people's opinions or analysis on videogames, while also having the oportunity to express themselves to other people, and to discuss different aspects.

### Roadmap / To Do / Steps:

| Status 📍 | Goal 🚀 |
| :---: | --- |
| ✔️ | Create repository to document changes and upload files  |
| ✔️ | Install XAMPP and check if it runs  |
| ❌ | Obtain a domain and link it with the XAMPP page  |
| ❌ | Find a good Videogame API / Gather data for the DB |
| ❌ | Install Workbench and create Database + add some info |
| ❌ | Create template pages with pure HTML & CSS  |
| ❌ | Display any DB information within the webpage  |
| ❓ | PHP for DB/HTML interaction or Node.JS  |

TODO: <br>
· Download $ Setup XAMPP <br>
· (optional) If MariaDB is not good, swap to MySQL <br>
· Download Workbench (So I don't have to work on phpMyAdmin...) <br>
· Check if any videogame API would be good, if not, videogame data will be inserted manually <br>
· Create the database, tables + some starting info <br>
· See if the webpage hosted on XAMPP, can be hosted on a domain <br>
· Create a default html page, to check if it can be shown on the domain <br>
· See how to display DB information on the webpage, and how to insert/delete stuff from DB from webpage <br>
· [...] <br>

Technologies used:<br>

Domain Host: No-IP<br>
XAMPP - Apache testing, Database and a nexus on where to store files, apps and everything<br>
HTML5 & CSS (Sass or Bootstrap): To create the webpage<br>

<br><br>

Steps:
1. Installed XAMPP
2. Installed Workbench (for a better visual experience)
3. Check if it can be linked with a NO-IP domain [!in need of testing!]
4. Check for a videogame API
5. Create the database
6. Create some main pages
7. Try to make any page interact with the database in any way
