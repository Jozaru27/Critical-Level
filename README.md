*Home repository for the ***Critical Level*** Page - a Web Project*<br><br>

![](https://github.com/Jozaru27/Critical-Level/blob/main/welcome.gif)

Critical Level is a web project in which I aspire to create, through my vision, a functional page in which people can express their thoughts and rankings about games, leaving reviews so other players can watch, read and comment, essentially exchanging information about their favourite games. 

The page will work as a IMDB-like service, in which people can either check other people's opinions or analysis on videogames, while also having the oportunity to express themselves to other people, and to discuss different aspects.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still being worked on, and so it's its documentation. Please be patient as stuff might be confusing at first!

| Status üìç | Goal üöÄ |
| :---: | --- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Create repository to document changes and upload files  |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Install XAMPP and check if it runs  |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Obtain a domain and link it with the XAMPP page  |
| ‚ùå | Find a good Videogame API / Gather data for the DB |
| ‚ùå | Install Workbench and create Database + add some info |
| ‚ùå | Create template pages with pure HTML & CSS  |
| ‚ùå | Display any DB information within the webpage  |
| ‚ùå | Test web with ZAP for any security breach |
| ‚ùì | PHP for DB/HTML interaction or Node.JS  |

* check for automatic moderation??

### First in depth look at the objective

The goal of this project, is to be able to host a page that hosts an ample selection of videogames, on which the registered or logged in users might be able to post reviews. The reviews will include a numeric score (either 1 to 5 stars, or 0/10 - 10/10, etc).
Other users, while still being able to post their own reviews, can choose to answer to an already posted review from another user, thus, creating a comment thread, in which they can discuss more profoundly said person's opinion, or add to it, etc.
That being the basic functionality of the page im trying to achieve, i'd like to delve further within, to cover additional features or techicalities. 

There's gonna be at least 2 user types: The admins and the users. While the users will do what was mentioned beforehand, the admins will make sure that the page functions correctly, check for manual moderation in the comments section and the reviews, as well as
manually adding the game, if the use of an API isn't viable. 

Now, when it comes to monetization, I would like to go further than annoying ads and/or kickstarters. The page could hold "benefit" products (will have to investigate what could be profitable without it ruining the user's experience). Those benefits could range from either being able to post more reviews or comments a day, being able to have a special supporter badge and name color, accessing restricted parts of the page, such as forums, on-line chats, being able to post guides, or images within the reviews. If there ever is a service like a "Match Making" (yes, a Tinder for gaming buddies), that could too be a paid option. Maybe even the page could hold online events, or promote phyiscal ones which you can only attend to by being a member. This must be explored, but not exploited.

A profile system could be implemented, to check each user's reviews, yes, but to also see a profile picture, short bio, stats like reviews posted, days logged-in, account creation date, or if it's ever implemented, a badge and reward system (posted 10 times, had a review with a score of 100 or more, etc)

### Roadmap details :
  
1. Create repository to document changes and upload files
   - Always wanted to create patch notes and keep a release history - well, here we are! :)
2. Install XAMPP and check if it runs
   - After not being convinced to use WAMPP, XAMPP seemed the better option to at least host stuff locally, but also to help with the public hosting
3. Obtain a domain and link it with the XAMPP page
   - After Port-Forwarding, was able to setup a basic domain thats linked with XAMPP (Local PC needs to be running for it to work D:) - DDNS so good it keeps track of my dynamic IP and auto-updates it!

<br><br><br>

TODO: <br>
¬∑ Download $ Setup XAMPP <br>
¬∑ (optional) If MariaDB is not good, swap to MySQL <br>
¬∑ Download Workbench (So I don't have to work on phpMyAdmin...) <br>
¬∑ Check if any videogame API would be good, if not, videogame data will be inserted manually <br>
¬∑ Create the database, tables + some starting info <br>
¬∑ See if the webpage hosted on XAMPP, can be hosted on a domain <br>
¬∑ Create a default html page, to check if it can be shown on the domain <br>
¬∑ See how to display DB information on the webpage, and how to insert/delete stuff from DB from webpage <br>
¬∑ [...] <br>

// UNDER CONSTRUCTION...<br><br><br>



Technologies used:<br>

Domain Host: No-IP<br>
XAMPP - Apache testing, Database and a nexus on where to store files, apps and everything<br>
HTML5 & CSS (Sass or Bootstrap): To create the webpage<br>

<br><br>

Steps:
1. Installed XAMPP
2. Installed Workbench (for a better visual experience)
3. Check if it can be linked with a NO-IP domain [!in need of testing!]
4. Check for a videogame API
5. Create the database
6. Create some main pages
7. Try to make any page interact with the database in any way
